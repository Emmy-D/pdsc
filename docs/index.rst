PDSC: Planetary Data System Coincidences
========================================

The purpose of this package is to allow quick querying via Python of remote
sensing observations made of a particular location on the surface of a planetary
body, or overlapping with another observation from any supported instrument.
Incidentally, :py:mod:`pdsc` also allows querying based on metadata and
transforming between pixel and world coordinate systems. Currently, only several
instruments from Mars orbiters are supported, but the system is designed to be
extensible to other instruments and bodies.
