PDSC: Planetary Data System Coincidences
========================================

This module allows ingesting/indexing and querying PDS data for the following
information:

  - Observation metadata
  - Observations meeting some basic metadata constraints (e.g., within date
    range or latitude range)
  - Localizing pixels within observations
  - Observations of a given latitude/longitude (or within some radius of that
    location)
  - Observations overlaping some other observation
